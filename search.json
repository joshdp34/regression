    "text": "1.1 The Probabilistic Model\nMost students who take an intro stats course are familiar with the idea of a random variable. Students are usually introduced to random variables using the notation \\(X\\).\nIn the technical sense, capital \\(X\\) should denote the random variable (that is, the function itself), while lowercase \\(x\\) denotes the values of that random variable. We will be loose on that convention, so you will see the lowercase used almost extensively even when discussing the random variable itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview: Random Variable\n\n\n\nA random variable is a function that assigns a numeric value to the outcomes in the sample space.\n\n\nIn regression, the random variable of interest is usually denoted as \\(y\\).\nWe want to predict or model (explain) this variable. Thus, we call this the response (or dependent) variable.\nIf we have measurements of this random variable, then we can express each value \\(y\\) as the mean value of \\(y\\) plus some random error.\nThat is, we can model the variable as \\[\n    y = E(y) + \\varepsilon\n\\tag{1.1}\\]\nwhere \\[\\begin{align*}\n    y = &\\text{ dependent variable}\\\\\n    E(y) =& \\text{ mean (or expected) value of } y\\\\\n    \\varepsilon =& \\text{ random error}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThis model is referred to as a probabilistic model for \\(y\\). The term “probabilistic” is used because, under certain assumptions, we can make probability-based statements about the extent of the difference between \\(y\\) and \\(E(y)\\).\nFor example, we might assert that the error term, \\[\n    \\varepsilon = y - E(y)\n\\] follows a normal distribution.\nIn practice, we will use sample data to estimate the parameters of the probabilistic model—specifically, the mean \\(E(y)\\) and the random error \\(\\varepsilon\\).\nWe will later discuss a common assumption in regression: that the mean error is zero.\nIn other words, \\[\n    E(\\varepsilon) = 0\n\\]\nGiven this assumption, our best estimate of \\(\\varepsilon\\) is zero. Therefore, we only need to estimate \\(E(y)\\).\nThe simplest method of estimating \\(E(y)\\) is to use the sample mean of \\(y\\) which we will denote as \\[\\begin{align*}\n    \\bar y= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\n\\end{align*}\\]\nIf we desired to predict a value of \\(y\\), then our best prediction would be just the sample mean: \\[\\begin{align*}\n    \\hat y = \\bar y\n\\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\hat y\\) denotes a predicted value of \\(y\\).\nThis would be the case with univariate data (we only have one variable in our data: \\(y\\)).\nUnfortunately, this simple model does not take into consideration a number of variables, called independent variables, that may help predict the response variable.\nIndependent variables are also called predictor or explanatory variables.\nThe process of identifying the mathematical model that describes the relationship between \\(y\\) and a set of independent variables, and that best fits the data, is known as regression analysis."

    "section": "1.3 Collecting the Data for Regression",
    "text": "1.3 Collecting the Data for Regression\nThe first step listed above will be discussed later.\nOnce you’ve proposed a model for \\(E(y)\\), the next step is to gather sample data to estimate the model.\nThis means collecting data on both the response variable \\(y\\) and the independent variables \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k\\) for each observation in your sample. In regression analysis, the sample includes data on multiple variables: \\[\ny, x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k\n\\] This is known as multivariate data.\nRegression data can be either observational or experimental:\nFor observational data no control is exerted over the independent variables (\\(x\\)’s). For example, recording people’s ages and their corresponding blood pressure levels without influencing either.\nFor experimental data the independent variables are controlled or manipulated. For instance, setting different fertilizer amounts for crops to observe the impact on growth.\nSuppose you want to model a student’s annual GPA (\\(y\\)). One approach is to randomly select a sample of \\(n=100\\) students and record their GPA along with the values of each predictor variable.\nData for the first three students in the sample are shown in Table 1.1.\n\n\nTable 1.1: Values of the response variable and predictor variables for the first three students.\n\n\n\nStudent 1\nStudent 2\nStudent 3\n\n\n\n\nAnnual GPA \\(y\\)\n3.8\n2.7\n3.5\n\n\nStudy Hours per Week, \\(x_1\\)\n15\n5\n10\n\n\nClass Attendance, \\(x_2\\) (days)\n30\n20\n25\n\n\nExtracurriculars, \\(x_3\\)\n2\n1\n3\n\n\nAge, \\(x_4\\) (years)\n21\n19\n22\n\n\nEmployed, \\(x_5\\) (1 if yes, 0 if no)\n0\n1\n0\n\n\nLives On Campus, \\(x_6\\) (1 if yes, 0 if no)\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, the \\(x\\) values, like study hours, class attendance, and extracurricular activities, are not predetermined before observing GPA \\(y\\); thus, the \\(x\\) values are uncontrolled. Therefore, the sample data are observational.\n\nDetermining Sample Size for Regression with Observational Data\nWhen applying regression to observational data, the required sample size for estimating the mean \\(E(y)\\) depends on three key factors:\n\nEstimated population standard deviation\nConfidence level\nDesired margin of error (half-width of the confidence interval)\n\nHowever, unlike the univariate case, \\(E(y)\\) is modeled as a function of multiple independent variables, which adds complexity. The sample size must be large enough to estimate and test all parameters in the model.\nTo ensure a sufficient sample size, a common guideline is to select a sample size \\(n\\) that is at least 10 times the number of parameters in the model.\nFor instance, if a university registrar’s office uses the following model for the annual GPA \\(y\\) of a current student:\n\\[E(y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_6 x_6\\]\nwhere \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_6\\) are defined in Table 1.1, the model includes six \\(\\beta\\) parameters (excluding \\(\\beta_0\\)). Therefore, they should include at least:\n\\[ 10 \\times 6 = 60 \\]\nstudents in the sample.\n\n\nExperimental Data\nThe second type of data in regression, experimental data, is generated through designed experiments where the independent variables are set in advance (i.e., controlled) before observing the value of \\(y\\).\nFor instance, consider a scenario where a researcher wants to study the effect of two independent variables—say, fertilizer amount \\(x_1\\) and irrigation level \\(x_2\\)—on the growth rate \\(y\\) of plants. The researcher could choose three levels of fertilizer (10g, 20g, and 30g) and three levels of irrigation (1L, 2L, and 3L) and measure the growth rate in one plant for each of the \\(3\\times 3=9\\) fertilizer–irrigation combinations (see Table 1.2 below).\n\n\nTable 1.2: Values of the response variable and two independent variables for the growth rate of plants.\n\n\nFertilizer, \\(x_1\\)\nIrrigation, \\(x_2\\)\nGrowth Rate, \\(y\\)\n\n\n\n\n10g\n1L\n5.2\n\n\n10g\n2L\n6.1\n\n\n10g\n3L\n5.8\n\n\n20g\n1L\n7.0\n\n\n20g\n2L\n7.5\n\n\n20g\n3L\n7.3\n\n\n30g\n1L\n8.4\n\n\n30g\n2L\n8.7\n\n\n30g\n3L\n8.1\n\n\n\n\nIn this experiment, the settings of the independent variables are controlled, in contrast to the uncontrolled nature of observational data, like in the real estate sales example.\nIn many studies, it is often not possible to control the values of the \\(x\\)’s, so most data collected for regression are observational.\nSo, why do we differentiate between these two types of data? We will learn that inferences from regression studies based on observational data have more limitations than those based on experimental data. Specifically, establishing a cause-and-effect relationship between variables is much more challenging with observational data than with experimental data."

    "text": "2.1 The Straight-Line Probabilistic Model\nWhen studying environmental science, consider modeling the monthly carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions \\(y\\) of a city as a function of its monthly industrial activity \\(x\\).\nThe first question to ask is: Do you believe an exact (deterministic) relationship exists between these two variables?\nIn other words, can we predict the exact value of CO₂ emissions if industrial activity is known?\nIt’s unlikely. CO₂ emissions depend on various factors beyond industrial activity, such as weather conditions, regulatory policies, and transportation levels. Even with multiple variables in the model, it’s improbable that we could predict monthly emissions precisely.\nThere will almost certainly be some variation in emissions due to random phenomena that cannot be fully explained or modeled.\nTherefore, we should propose a probabilistic model for CO₂ emissions that accounts for this random variation:\n\\[\ny = E(y) + \\varepsilon\n\\]\nThe random error component,\\(\\varepsilon\\), captures all unexplained variations in emissions caused by omitted variables or unpredictable random factors.\nThe random error plays a key role in hypothesis testing, determining confidence intervals for the model’s deterministic portion, and estimating the prediction error when using the model to predict future values of \\(y\\).\nLet’s start with the simplest probabilistic model—a first-order linear model that graphs as a straight line."

    "text": "3.2 Model Assumptions\nLet’s now focus on the random component \\(\\varepsilon\\) in the probabilistic model and its connection to the errors in estimating \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\).\nSpecifically, we’ll explore how the probability distribution of \\(\\varepsilon\\) influences the accuracy of the model in representing the true relationship between the dependent variable \\(y\\) and the independent variable \\(x\\).\nWe make four key assumptions about the probability distribution of \\(\\varepsilon\\):\n\nThe mean of \\(\\varepsilon\\)’s probability distribution is 0. This means that, on average, the errors cancel out over an infinitely large number of experiments for each value of the independent variable \\(x\\). Consequently, the mean value of \\(y\\), \\(E(y)\\), for a given \\(x\\) is \\(E(y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\).\nThe variance of \\(\\varepsilon\\)’s probability distribution is constant across all values of the independent variable \\(x\\). For our linear model, this implies that the variance of \\(\\varepsilon\\) is a constant, say, \\(\\sigma^2\\), regardless of the value of \\(x\\).\nThe probability distribution of \\(\\varepsilon\\) is normal.\nThe errors for different observations are independent. In other words, the error for one value of \\(y\\) does not influence the errors for other \\(y\\) values.\n\nThe implications of the first three assumptions can be seen in Figure 3.1;, which shows distributions of errors for four particular values of \\(x\\).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: The probability distribution of \\(\\varepsilon\\). At every value of \\(x\\), there is a distribution of \\(y\\) values that satisfy the four assumptions listed above. The red points are observed values.\n\n\n\nFrom Figure 3.1, we see that the probability distributions of the errors are normal, with a mean of 0 and a constant variance \\(\\sigma^2\\).\nThe line in the middle of the curve that goes to the regression line represents the mean value of \\(y\\) for a given value of \\(x\\). The line of means is given by the equation: \\[\nE(y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\n\\]\nThese assumptions allow us to create measures of reliability for the least squares estimators and to develop hypothesis tests to evaluate the utility of the least squares line.\nVarious diagnostic techniques are available for checking the validity of these assumptions, and these diagnostics suggest remedies when the assumptions seem invalid.\nTherefore, it is crucial to apply these diagnostic tools in every regression analysis. We will discuss these techniques in detail later.\nIn practice, the assumptions do not need to hold exactly for least squares estimators and test statistics to have the reliability we expect from a regression analysis. The assumptions will be sufficiently satisfied for many real-world applications."

    "text": "3.3 An Estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\)\n\nThe variability of random error, measured by its variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), plays a crucial role in the accuracy of estimating model parameters \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), as well as in the precision of predictions when using \\(\\hat{y}\\) to estimate \\(y\\) for a given value of \\(x\\). As a result, it is expected that \\(\\sigma^2\\) will appear in the formulas for confidence intervals and test statistics.\nIn most real-world scenarios, \\(\\sigma^2\\) is unknown and must be estimated using the available data. The best estimate for \\(\\sigma^2\\) is \\(s^2\\), calculated by dividing the sum of squares of residuals by the associated degrees of freedom (df). The sum of squares of residuals is given by: \\[\nSSE = \\sum \\left(y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\right)^2\n\\]\nIn a simple linear regression model, 2 degrees of freedom are used to estimate the y-intercept and slope, leaving \\((n - 2)\\) degrees of freedom for estimating the error variance. Thus, the estimate of \\(\\sigma^2\\) is: \\[\n\\begin{align*}\ns^2 &= \\frac{SSE}{n-2}\\\\\n&= \\frac{\\sum \\left(y_i - \\hat{y}_ i\\right)^2}{n-2}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThis \\(s^2\\) serves as the basis for further statistical analysis, including the construction of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.\nThe value of \\(s^2\\) is referred to as the mean square error (MSE).\nThe value \\[\\begin{align*}\ns &= \\sqrt{s^2}\n\\end{align*}\\] is referred to as the standard error of the regression model or as the root MSE (RMSE).\nUsing the empirical rule, we expect approximately 95% of the observed \\(y\\) values to lie within \\(2s\\) of their respective least squares predicted values, \\(\\hat y\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview: The Empirical Rule\n\n\n\nRecall the empirical rule applies to distributions that are mound-shaped and symmetric. It state that approximately 68% of the distribution is within one standard deviation of the mean, approximately 95% of the distribution is within two standard deviations of the mean, and approximatley 99.7% of the distribution is withing three standard deviations of the mean. Since we assume \\(\\varepsilon\\) is normally distributed, then the empirical rule holds.\n\n\n\nExample 3.2 (Example 3.1 - revisited) We can use the summary() function with the fit from lm to obtain the summary stats of the fit.\n\nfit = lm(mpg~wt, data = mtcars)\n\nfit |&gt; summary()\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-4.5432 -2.3647 -0.1252  1.4096  6.8727 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

That is, \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{SSE}{\\sigma^{2}} & \\sim\\chi^{2}\\left(n-2\\right)\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nWe will use another important theorem form math stats (again presented without proof):\n\nTheorem 4.5 (Ratio of independent standard normal and chi-square statistics) If \\(Z\\sim N\\left(0,1\\right)\\) and \\(W\\sim\\chi^{2}\\left(\\nu\\right)\\), and \\(Z\\) and \\(W\\) are independent, then the statistic \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{Z}{\\sqrt{\\frac{W}{\\nu}}}\n\\end{align*}\\] is distributed as a Student’s \\(t\\) distribution with \\(\\nu\\) degrees of freedom.\n\nWe will take the standardized score in Equation 4.13 and divide by \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{\\left(n-2\\right)s^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}}}{\\left(n-2\\right)}} & =\\sqrt{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}}}\n\\end{align*}\\] to give us \\[\\begin{align*}\nt & =\\frac{\\frac{b_1-\\beta_{1}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{\\sum\\left(x_i-\\overline{X}\\right)^{2}}}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}}}}\\\\\n& =\\frac{b_1-\\beta_{1}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{\\sum\\left(x_i-\\overline{X}\\right)^{2}}}\\sqrt{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}}}}\\\\\n& =\\frac{b_1-\\beta_{1}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\sum\\left(x_i-\\overline{X}\\right)^{2}}}}\n\\end{align*}\\] which will have a Student’s \\(t\\) distribution with \\(n-2\\) degrees of freedom."

    "text": "4.6 Assessing the Utility of the Model: Making Inferences About the Slope\nSuppose that the independent variable \\(x\\) is completely unrelated to the dependent variable \\(y\\).\nWhat could be said about the values of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) in the hypothesized probabilistic model \\[\\begin{align*}\n    y = \\beta_0 +\\beta_1 x + \\varepsilon\n\\end{align*}\\] if \\(x\\) contributes no information for the prediction of \\(y\\)?\nThe implication is that the mean of \\(y\\), does not change as \\(x\\) changes. In other words, the line would just be a horizontal line.\nIf \\(E(y)\\) does not change as \\(x\\) increases, then using \\(x\\) to predict \\(y\\) in the linear model is not useful.\nRegardless of the value of \\(x\\), you always predict the same value of \\(y\\). In the straight-line model, this means that the true slope, \\(\\beta_1\\), is equal to 0.\nTherefore, to test the null hypothesis that \\(x\\) contributes no information for the prediction of \\(y\\) against the alternative hypothesis that these variables are linearly related with a slope differing from 0, we test \\[\\begin{align*}\n    H_0:\\beta_1 = 0\\\\\n    H_a:\\beta_1\\ne 0\n\\end{align*}\\]\nIf the data support the alternative hypothesis, we conclude that \\(x\\) does contribute information for the prediction of \\(y\\) using the straight-line model (although the true relationship between \\(E(y)\\) and \\(x\\) could be more complex than a straight line). Thus, to some extent, this is a test of the utility of the hypothesized model.\nThe appropriate test statistic is the studentized score given above: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n    t &= \\frac{b_1-\\beta_{1}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s^{2}}{\\sum\\left(x_i-\\overline{X}\\right)^{2}}}}\\\\\n    &=\\frac{b_1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s^{2}}{SS_{xx}}}}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{4.15}\\]\nAnother way to make inferences about the slope \\(\\beta_1\\) is to estimate it using a confidence interval \\[\n\\begin{align}\n    b_1 \\pm \\left(t_{\\alpha/2}\\right)s_{b_1}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{4.16}\\] where \\[\\begin{align*}\n    s_{b_1} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{SS_{xx}}}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe can obtain the p-value for the hypothesis test by using the summary function with an lm object.

This is because these observations have values of \\(x\\) that are below \\(\\bar{x}\\) and values of \\(y\\) that are below \\(\\bar{y}\\), or values of \\(x\\) that are above \\(\\bar{x}\\) and values of \\(y\\) that are above \\(\\bar{y}\\).\nThere are four observations that have a negative value of \\((x-\\bar{x})(y-\\bar{y})\\). Although they are negative, the value of \\(SS_{xy}\\) is positive due to all the observations with positive values of \\((x-\\bar{x})(y-\\bar{y})\\). Therefore, we say if \\(SS_{xy}\\) is positive, then \\(y\\) tends to increase as \\(x\\) increases. Likewise, if \\(SS_{xy}\\) is negative, then \\(y\\) tends to decrease as \\(x\\) increases.\nIf \\(SS_{xy}\\) is zero (or close to zero), then we say \\(y\\) does not tend to change as \\(x\\) increases.\n\n\n5.1.1 Defining the Correlation Coefficient\nWe first note that \\(SS_{xy}\\) cannot be greater in absolute value than the quantity \\[\n\\sqrt{SS_{xx}SS_{yy}}\n\\] We will not prove this here, but it is a direct application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality .\nWe define the linear correlation coefficient as \\[\n\\begin{align}\n    r=\\frac{SS_{xy}}{\\sqrt{SS_{xx}SS_{yy}}}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{5.1}\\]\n\\(r\\) is also called the Pearson correlation coefficient.\nWe note that \\[\n-1\\le r \\le 1\n\\]\nIf \\(r=0\\), then there is no linear relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\nIf \\(r\\) is positive, then the slope of the linear relationship is positive. If \\(r\\) is negative, then the slope of the linear relationship is negative.\nThe closer \\(r\\) is to one in absolute value, the stronger the linear relationship is between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n5.1.2 Some Examples of \\(r\\)\n\nThe best way to grasp correlation is to see examples. In Figure 5.1, scatterplots of 200 observations are shown with a least squares line.\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) \\(r=-0.079\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) \\(r=-0.672\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) \\(r=0.723\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) \\(r=0.524\\)\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Examples of correlation\n\n\nNote how the value of \\(r\\) relates to how spread out the points are from the line as well as to the slope of the line.\nThe correlation coefficient, \\(r\\), quantifies the strength of the linear relationship between two variables, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), similar to the way the least squares slope, \\(b_1\\), does. However, unlike the slope, the correlation coefficient is scaleless. This means that the value of \\(r\\) always falls between \\(\\pm 1\\), regardless of the units used for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\nThe calculation of \\(r\\) uses the same data that is used to fit the least squares line. Given that both \\(r\\) and \\(b_1\\) offer insight into the utility of the model, it’s not surprising that their computational formulas are related.\nIt’s also important to remember that a high correlation does not imply causality. If a high positive or negative value of \\(r\\) is observed, this does not mean that changes in \\(x\\) cause changes in \\(y\\). The only valid conclusion is that there may be a linear relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n5.1.3 The Population Correlation Coefficient\nThe correlation \\(r\\) is for the observed data which is usually from a sample. Thus, \\(r\\) is the sample correlation coefficient.\nWe could make a hypothesis about the correlation of the population based on the sample. We will denote the population correlation with \\(\\rho\\). The hypothesis we will want to test is \\[\\begin{align*}\n  H_0:\\rho = 0\\\\\nH_a:\\rho \\ne 0\n\\end{align*}\\]\nRecall the hypothesis test for the slope in Section 4.6.\nIf we test \\[\\begin{align*}\nH_{0}: & \\beta_{1}=0\\\\\nH_{a}: & \\beta_{1}\\ne0\n\\end{align*}\\] then this is equivalent to testing1 \\[\\begin{align*}\nH_{0}: & \\rho=0\\\\\nH_{a}: & \\rho\\ne0\n\\end{align*}\\] since both hypotheses test to see of there is a linear relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\nNow note, using Equation 2.5, that \\(b_1\\) can be rewritten as \\[\n\\begin{align}\nb_1 & =\\frac{\\sum\\left(x_{i}-\\bar{x}\\right)\\left(y_{i}-\\bar{y}\\right)}{\\sum\\left(x_{i}-\\bar{x}\\right)^{2}}\\\\\n& =\\frac{SS_{xy}}{SS_{xx}}\\\\\n& =\\frac{rSS_{xy}}{rSS_{xx}}\\\\\n& =\\frac{rSS_{xy}}{\\frac{SS_{xy}}{\\sqrt{SS_{xx}SS_{yy}}}SS_{xx}}\\\\\n& =\\frac{r\\sqrt{SS_{xx}SS_{yy}}}{SS_{xx}}\\\\\n& =r\\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{SS_{xx}}{n-1}\\frac{SS_{yy}}{n-1}}}{\\frac{SS_{xx}}{n-1}}\\\\\n& =r\\frac{s_{X}s_{Y}}{s_{X}^{2}}\\\\\n& =r\\frac{s_{y}}{s_{X}}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{5.2}\\] where \\(s_{y}\\) and \\(s_{x}\\) are the sample standard deviation of \\(y\\) and \\(x\\), respectively.\nThe test statistic is \\[\n\\begin{align}\nt & =\\frac{r\\sqrt{\\left(n-2\\right)}}{\\sqrt{1-r^{2}}}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{5.3}\\]\nIf \\(H_0\\) is true, then \\(t\\) will have a Student’s \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(n-2\\) degrees of freedom.\nThe only real difference between the least squares slope \\(b_1\\) and the coefficient of correlation \\(r\\) is the measurement scale2.\nTherefore, the information they provide about the utility of the least squares model is to some extent redundant.\nFurthermore, the slope \\(b_1\\) gives us additional information on the amount of increase (or decrease) in \\(y\\) for every 1-unit increase in \\(x\\).\nFor this reason, the slope is recommended for making inferences about the existence of a positive or negative linear relationship between two variables."

It is just a measure of how \\(y\\) deviates from its mean \\(\\bar{y}\\).\nWe also have the variability of the points about the line. We can measure this with the sum of squares error \\[\nSSE = \\sum \\left(y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\right)^2\n\\]\nNote that SSE does include \\(x\\). This is because the fitted line \\(\\hat{y}\\) is a function of \\(x\\).\nHere are a couple of key points regarding sums of squares:\n\nIf \\(x\\) provides little to no useful information for predicting \\(y\\), then \\(SS_{yy}\\) and \\(SSE\\) will be nearly equal.\nIf \\(x\\) does provide valuable information for predicting \\(y\\), then \\(SSE\\) will be smaller than \\(SS_{yy}\\).\nIn the extreme case where all points lie exactly on the least squares line, \\(SSE = 0\\).\n\nHere’s an example to illustrate:\nSuppose we have data for two variables, hours studied (x) and test scores (y). If studying time doesn’t help predict the test score, the variation in test scores (measured by \\(SS_{yy}\\)) will be similar to the error in the prediction (measured by \\(SSE\\)). However, if studying time is a good predictor, the prediction errors will be much smaller, making \\(SSE\\) significantly smaller than \\(SS_{yy}\\). If the relationship between study time and test scores is perfect, then the error would be zero, resulting in \\(SSE = 0\\).\n\n5.2.1 Proportion of Variation Explained\nWe want to explain as much of the variation of \\(y\\) as possible. So we want to know just how much of that variation is explained by using linear regression model with \\(x\\). We can quantify this variation explained by taking the difference \\[\n\\begin{align}\n    SSR = SS_{yy}-SSE\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{5.4}\\]\nSSR is called the sum of squares regression.\nWe calculate the proportion of the variation of \\(y\\) explained by the regression model using \\(x\\) by calculating3 \\[\n\\begin{align}\n    r^2 = \\frac{SSR}{SS_{yy}}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{5.5}\\]\n\\(r^2\\) is called the coefficient of determination4\nPractical Interpretation:\nAbout \\(100(r^2)\\%\\) of the sample variation in \\(y\\) (measured by the total sum of squares of deviations of the sample \\(y\\)-values about their mean \\(\\bar{y}\\)) can be explained by (or attributed to) using \\(x\\) to predict \\(y\\) in the straight-line model.\n\nExample 5.3 (Example 5.2 revisited) We can find the coefficient of determination using the summary function with an lm object.\n\nlibrary(datasets)\n\nfit = lm(Volume~Girth, data = trees)\n\nfit |&gt; summary()\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Volume ~ Girth, data = trees)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-8.065 -3.107  0.152  3.495  9.587 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This will find the correlation coefficient for each pair of variables in the dataframe. Note that there can only be quantitative variables in the dataframe in order this function to work.\n\ntrees |&gt; cor()\n\n           Girth    Height    Volume\nGirth  1.0000000 0.5192801 0.9671194\nHeight 0.5192801 1.0000000 0.5982497\nVolume 0.9671194 0.5982497 1.0000000\n\n\nSo the correlation between Girth and Volume is 0.9671."

We will denote this predicted value as \\(y_{h\\left(pred\\right)}\\).\n\n6.2.2 Prediction When the True Line is Known\nOur best point predictor will be the mean (since it is the most likely value). If we knew the the true regression line, then we could predict at \\[\\begin{align*}\ny_{h\\left(pred\\right)} & =\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}x_{h}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe variance of \\(y_{h\\left(pred\\right)}\\) would be \\[\\begin{align*}\nVar\\left[y_{h}\\right] & =\\sigma^{2}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThen we can be \\(\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)100\\%\\) confident that the predicted value \\(y_{h\\left(pred\\right)}\\) is \\[\\begin{align*}\nz_{\\alpha/2}\\sigma\n\\end{align*}\\] units away from the line.\nIf we don’t know \\(\\sigma\\), then we could estimate it with \\(s\\) and we can be \\(\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)100\\%\\) confident that the predicted value \\(y_{h\\left(pred\\right)}\\) is \\[\\begin{align*}\nt_{\\alpha/2}s\n\\end{align*}\\] units away from the line.\n\n6.2.3 Predicting When the True Line is Unknown\nOf course, we do not know the true regression line.

From Equation 6.1, that sampling distribution has a variance of \\[\\begin{align*}\nVar\\left[\\hat{y}_{h}\\right] & =\\sigma^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{\\left(x_{h}-\\bar{x}\\right)^{2}}{\\sum\\left(x_{i}-\\bar{x}\\right)^{2}}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThus, the variance of the prediction of \\(y_{h\\left(pred\\right)}\\) will be the sum of the variance of the response variable: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\sigma^{2}\n\\end{align*}\\] and the variance of the fitted line: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\sigma^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{\\left(x_{h}-\\bar{x}\\right)^{2}}{\\sum\\left(x_{i}-\\bar{x}\\right)^{2}}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nSo the variance of \\(y_{h\\left(pred\\right)}\\) is \\[\\begin{align*}\nVar\\left[y_{h\\left(pred\\right)}\\right] & =\\sigma^{2}+\\sigma^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{\\left(x_{h}-\\bar{x}\\right)^{2}}{\\sum\\left(x_{i}-\\bar{x}\\right)^{2}}\\right)\\\\\n& =\\sigma^{2}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{\\left(x_{h}-\\bar{x}\\right)^{2}}{\\sum\\left(x_{i}-\\bar{x}\\right)^{2}}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nSince \\(y\\) is normally distributed, then we have a \\(\\left(100-\\alpha\\right)100\\%\\) prediction interval for \\(y_{h\\left(pred\\right)}\\) as \\[\n\\begin{align}\n{\\hat{y}_{h} \\pm t_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{s^{2}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{\\left(x_{h}-\\bar{x}\\right)^{2}}{\\sum\\left(x_{i}-\\bar{x}\\right)^{2}}\\right)}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]#eq-w2_21\n\nExample 6.1 (Example 5.2 revisited) Let’s examine the trees data from Example 5.2.\nRecall the least squares fit:\n\nlibrary(datasets)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nggplot(data=trees, aes(x=Girth, y=Volume))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method='lm',formula=y~x,se = F)\n\n\n\nfit = lm(Volume~Girth, data=trees)\nfit\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Volume ~ Girth, data = trees)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)        Girth  \n    -36.943        5.066  \n\n\nTo find the confidence and prediction intervals, we must construct a new data frame with the value of \\(X_h\\). This value is then used, along with the lm object, to the predict function. If no value of \\(X_h\\) is provided, then predict will provide intervals for all values of \\(x\\) found in the data used in lm.\nRecall the least squares fit:\n\n# get a 95% confidence interval for the mean Volume\n# when girth is 16\nxh=data.frame(Girth=16)\n\nfit |&gt; predict(xh,interval=\"confidence\",level=0.95)\n\n       fit      lwr      upr\n1 44.11024 42.01796 46.20252\n\n# 95% prediction interval for one value of Volume when\n# girth is 16\nfit |&gt; predict(xh,interval=\"prediction\",level=0.95)\n\n       fit     lwr      upr\n1 44.11024 35.1658 53.05469\n\n\nWe can plot the confidence interval for all values of \\(x\\) by using the geom_smooth command in ggplot:\n\nggplot(data=trees, aes(x=Girth, y=Volume)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method='lm',formula=y~x)\n\n\n\n\nWe can plot prediction intervals by adding them manually:\n\npred_int = fit |&gt; predict(interval=\"prediction\",level=0.95) |&gt; as.data.frame()\ndat = cbind(trees, pred_int)\n\nggplot(data=dat, aes(x=Girth, y=Volume)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method='lm',formula=y~x) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=lwr), color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_line(aes(y=upr), color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nNote that the prediction interval (the red dashed lines) is wider than the prediction interval. This is because the prediction interval has the extra source of variability.\n\n\n6.2.5 Extrapolation and Precision\nWhen using the least squares prediction equation to estimate the mean value of \\(y\\) or to predict a particular value of \\(y\\) for values of \\(x\\) outside the range of your sample data, you may encounter much larger errors than expected. This practice is known as extrapolation.\nEven though the least squares model might fit the data well within the range of sample \\(x\\) values, it can poorly represent the true model for values of \\(x\\) outside this range.\nAs the sample size \\(n\\) increases, the width of the confidence interval decreases. In theory, you can achieve as precise an estimate of the mean value of \\(y\\) as desired for any given \\(x\\) by selecting a large enough sample.\nSimilarly, the prediction interval for a new value of \\(y\\) also becomes narrower as \\(n\\) increases. However, the prediction interval has a lower limit, which is reflected in the formula:\n\\[\n\\hat{y} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\sigma\n\\]\nThis means that no matter how large the sample, the interval can’t shrink below a certain size unless you reduce the standard deviation of the regression model, \\(\\sigma\\). To make more accurate predictions for new values of \\(y\\), you must improve the model—either by using a curvilinear relationship with \\(x\\), adding new independent variables, or both."
